				Annotations are additions - links, block quotes, inline - microformats and microdata; out of band webmention + pingback
			</p>
			<p>
				we want annotations to be decentralized, so they need to interoperate with a data model and component models
			</p>
			<p>
				We are going to need syndication and discovery for annotations
			</p>
			<p>
				we want a more read/write web - we deserve the freedom to reference, not overload URI syntax forever
			</p>
			<p>
				how do we go from out of band to inline? How do you show a remote annotation in the text you're reading
			</p>
			<p>
				existing event targets are DOM element, but we want to target the data -the text of the page idea: event.dataTarget
			</p>
			<p>
				how about a selection pseudo element - can we describe a selection, style it and not modify the DOM - like a:visited
			</p>
			<p>
				we need feed discovery - Activity Streams. Also we need to publish locally and use WebMention <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention</a>

				I'm PM on Office Online, working on accessibility - we have annotations in Office and visual studio already
			</p>
			<p>
				red underlines in Word and breakpoints in Visual Studio are annotations form our point of view [machine generated]
			</p>
			<p>
				we've been thinking about how to connect screen readers to annotations - to know there is one, to jump in and out
			</p>
			<p>
				we can use an aria.annotationtype of "comment" and point to the element with the comment with aria.annotatedby

				Annotation is used throughout the research process, and for teaching not just as part of publications
			</p>
			<p>
				researchers need to annotate maps, 3D spaces, protein models, sensor data streams , textual variants
			</p>
			<p>
				scholary annotation requirements: citable; precise; of segments/regions; many data types; within dynamic web apps
			</p>
			<p>
				we need to migrate annotations across multiple copies of identical resources, or modified ones
			</p>
			<p>
				stand-off annotation is needed to maintain integrity of original resources
			</p>
			<p>
				we use the Annotea, OA model so have shared generic backend, but need protocols and APIs too
			</p>
			<p>
				the OA model is extremely flexible, but diffciult to implement as the queries are hard to write

				data models are simple; protocols harder, but user interactions are hard enough that we'd take us years to agree
			</p>
			<p>
				a bookmarklet is basically a cross-site scripting attack. A standard known as content security policy breaks them
			</p>
			<p>
				Browser extensions are not standardised - every user agent has its own extension model
			</p>
			<p>
				Does anyone know for proposals to allow user-trusted code to run in the DOM in a standard way? Nope

				we either need to spec ALL the things, or build for pluralism so there are many ways to do it

				As a publisher, having notes you take on Kindle not translating to ibooks is really annoying
			</p>
			<p>
				we get complaints from readers all the time about the "1000 people marked this page" stuff in Kindle
			</p>
			<p>
				we do pop-ups of footnotes and publication history in our online journals
			</p>
			<p>
				we have third party annotations from reference management and social media crawling
			</p>
			<p>
				the only way to annotate our works is with the "contact us" button that emails the publisher- can take 2 years
			</p>
			<p>
				we have multiple different annotations at different levels of the publishing process paper/Word/PDF
			</p>
			<p>
				we have extensive annotations in our new journals online product , and for assignments and quizzes

				provenance of annotations is important - this brings in identity issues. Iterating them is also hard

				the interactions in the various different document viewers are cumbersome and inconsistent

				robust note authoring shouldn't block what you are annotating. It should let you re-anchor after composition
