				Annotations are additions - links, block quotes, inline - microformats and microdata; out of band webmention + pingback
			</p>
			<p>
				we want annotations to be decentralized, so they need to interoperate with a data model and component models
			</p>
			<p>
				We are going to need syndication and discovery for annotations
			</p>
			<p>
				we want a more read/write web - we deserve the freedom to reference, not overload URI syntax forever
			</p>
			<p>
				how do we go from out of band to inline? How do you show a remote annotation in the text you're reading
			</p>
			<p>
				existing event targets are DOM element, but we want to target the data -the text of the page idea: event.dataTarget
			</p>
			<p>
				how about a selection pseudo element - can we describe a selection, style it and not modify the DOM - like a:visited
			</p>
			<p>
				we need feed discovery - Activity Streams. Also we need to publish locally and use WebMention <a class="auto-link" href="http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention">http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention</a>

			<p>
				I'm PM on Office Online, working on accessibility - we have annotations in Office and visual studio already
			</p>
			<p>
				red underlines in Word and breakpoints in Visual Studio are annotations form our point of view [machine generated]
			</p>
			<p>
				we've been thinking about how to connect screen readers to annotations - to know there is one, to jump in and out
			</p>
			<p>
				we can use an aria.annotationtype of "comment" and point to the element with the comment with aria.annotatedby

				Annotation is used throughout the research process, and for teaching not just as part of publications
			</p>
			<p>
				researchers need to annotate maps, 3D spaces, protein models, sensor data streams , textual variants
			</p>
			<p>
				scholary annotation requirements: citable; precise; of segments/regions; many data types; within dynamic web apps
			</p>
			<p>
				we need to migrate annotations across multiple copies of identical resources, or modified ones
			</p>
			<p>
				stand-off annotation is needed to maintain integrity of original resources
			</p>
			<p>
				we use the Annotea, OA model so have shared generic backend, but need protocols and APIs too
			</p>
			<p>
				the OA model is extremely flexible, but diffciult to implement as the queries are hard to write
			</p>

				Logos is a digital library for biblical studies, with very rich annotation and cross referencing tools
			</p>
			<p>
				our app is not out on the web, but a desktop app you download.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bible has book/chapter/verse and we add word, but they are different between some bibles
			</p>
			<p>
				we care about cross-lingual word alignment for annotations, which requires extra standardizations

			<p>
				data models are simple; protocols harder, but user interactions are hard enough that we'd take us years to agree
			</p>
			<p>
				a bookmarklet is basically a cross-site scripting attack. A standard known as content security policy breaks them
			</p>
			<p>
				Browser extensions are not standardised - every user agent has its own extension model
			</p>
			<p>
				Does anyone know for proposals to allow user-trusted code to run in the DOM in a standard way? Nope
			</p>
			<p>
				we either need to spec ALL the things, or build for pluralism so there are many ways to do it

				As a publisher, having notes you take on Kindle not translating to ibooks is really annoying
			</p>
			<p>
				we get complaints from readers all the time about the "1000 people marked this page" stuff in Kindle
			</p>
			<p>
				we do pop-ups of footnotes and publication history in our online journals
			</p>
			<p>
				we have third party annotations from reference management and social media crawling
			</p>
			<p>
				the only way to annotate our works is with the "contact us" button that emails the publisher- can take 2 years
			</p>
			<p>
				we have multiple different annotations at different levels of the publishing process paper/Word/PDF
			</p>
			<p>
				we have extensive annotations in our new journals online product , and for assignments and quizzes
			</p>
			<p>
				what happens to annotations when content has been deleted? Or out of print? [odd concept for web]

			<p>
				people annotate books but also movies and sound too where you have to point at timestamps
			</p>
			<p>
				teachers comment on student assignments and students can respond inline
			</p>
			<p>
				provenance of annotations is important - this brings in identity issues. Iterating them is also hard
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't think we should rework the Open Annotation data model, but we need RESTful search and JSON-LD output

				STM is a small publisher with complex texts including arabic, hebrew and heiroglyphics
			</p>
			<p>
				our policy is ePub firts, no DRM, one purchase for all formats
			</p>
			<p>
				we have ePub with interactive maps of the Karnak temple that link to images of the wall paintings
			</p>
			<p>
				referencing other works is required for scholarly publications, but page number doesn't work across editions
			</p>
			<p>
				for epub we need something user-raedable and reader-processable - people like "page 23" not ids
			</p>
			<p>
				we need it to be independent of paper, pdf, epub that can survive reflowing, and human readable
			</p>
			<p>
				in epub you can mark the page boundaries of the original document in the HTML but doesn't go the other way
			</p>
			<p>
				numbered paragraphs within chapters can work for finished works - easy to quote
			</p>
			<p>
				we need readable shortcuts, not 64-character hashes - like link shorteners

				the interactions in the various different document viewers are cumbersome and inconsistent
			</p>
			<p>
				creating the notes content first and then anchoring to the document makes more sense
			</p>
			<p>
				robust note authoring shouldn't block what you are annotating. It should let you re-anchor after composition
			</p>
			<p>
				we need to account for longer notes, that may be longer than the entire text
			</p>
			<p>
				also define print styles for CSS so that users can print out the whole thing

				at <a class="auto-link" href="http://Hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a> we're working on an annotation system for the web and we have proposed solutions
			</p>
			<p>
				 annotating web documentsnis good, but we added PDF, Epub and would like to add scribd and google docs too
			</p>
			<p>
				we define a target with generic selectors xpath, but also text position and text content selectors
			</p>
			<p>
				by having multiple selectors we can use fuzzy matching to find the parts we want
			</p>
			<p>
				there is a problem with dynamic sites, we need dynamic anchoring - comments can be oprhaned

				at University of Reading, I work on CHARMe which annotates climate datasets

				Scientists get huge numbers of options for data from data providers, but the annotations aren't lined

				A climate Dataset may be a table, a time series, a map a 3d model or an animation

			<p>
				climate data users reserach timing, specific areas of the world, and comparing datasets
			</p>
			<p>
				climate data comes in 2d, 3d and 4d formats - layers of images at different res or sensors

			<p>
				the annotation document needs to be stored somewhere - think of it as channels
